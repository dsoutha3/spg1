Does matt care about having a complete game for a grade?

Is this class about taking the hard road and learning from it even if this means not completing, or taking the easy road and complete the task?

How is this class teaching us about any of the following: File and Device I/O, timers, process management, sockets, threads, file systems, terminals, signals, pipes, semaphores. Focus on concurrency and effective resource utilization. 

Are we suppose to learn these things on our own? are we getting to them?
